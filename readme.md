# React Native Shared Element Transition - Pokédex

## ⭐ Give this repository a star! ⭐

This is a simple React Native App to demonstrate how Shared Elements transition works using Navigation.

I've utilized the [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co) to fetch and show some cute little creatures.

Also, to make it ⚡ <b style="color: #8b5cf6">blazing fast</b> ⚡ to show and scroll through the pokémon list, I've used [FlashList](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/docs/), which is a modern and optimized way to create lists in React Native.
